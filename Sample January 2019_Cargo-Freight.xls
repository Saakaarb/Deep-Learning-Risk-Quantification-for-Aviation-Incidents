In the turn to intercept the LOC the PF airspeed and altitude tapes began to increase rapidly. This caused the autopilot to disengage, the Auto Throttle to disengage, the L and R ENG EEC to indicate off, the TERRAIN SYS OVRD to FAIL and the L transponder to fail. In addition, there were comparator indications on the PFD and the overspeed warning sounded. The altitude and airspeed tapes did not freeze or slowly indicate a difference. It was rapid and continuous. The comparator indications were present but due to the complexity of the situation I do not recall each comparator that was displayed. Once all the above occurred while in the turn the PF did his best to quickly cross check and determine which flight instruments were providing good information and which were providing bad information. We were able to determine the right avionics and standby avionics information was good and the left air data information was bad. This was all occurring while hand flying and trying to maintain the LOC course and assigned altitude. Due to the loss of the left transponder ATC approach was not receiving an altitude input from us and asked to verify altitude. The Captain as PF when the failure occurred transferred controls to the First Officer once the airplane was stable and the determination was made that the First Officer (FO) avionics information was accurate. The First Officer became the PF and the Captain became the Pilot Monitoring (PM). The Captain assumed radio communication and advised ATC that we have an avionics malfunction. The PM then reported to ATC our current altitude and deviation from the LOC as we worked to center the LOC guidance. With the airplane stable at 4000 ft and on the 36L LOC the PM told ATC that we would like a vector away from the immediate airport area to reference our checklist and would like to stay within 20 miles of the airport. Due to the busyness of [the situation] the PM requested that ATC provide holding type vectors and that we could not accept a holding pattern. This was to prevent either pilot from being heads down setting up the FMS. Once on a heading out of the immediate approach traffic area and stable at 4000 ft the PM referenced the QRH. There were approximately 5 Amber CAS messages displayed associated with the failures. The L ENG EEC and R ENG EEC messages were referenced in the QRH. This guidance did not apply to the root of the problem based on the air data system failures and we discussed that we should focus on the Airspeed Unreliable checklist. We followed the Airspeed Unreliable non-normal QRH procedure. The PM completed the checklist and the PF monitored the airplane. Following the checklist guidance, we reengaged the autopilot to help with workload management. Once the checklist was complete and we were holding on the deferred items the PM (Captain) brought to the PF's attention that as an additional tool we could radio Dispatch and have them communicate with Maintenance to determine if there were any further actions we could take with their guidance. At the time we had approximately 13,000 lbs of gas and both agreed we had time to get additional guidance. The PF took over ATC communications and the PM communicated with Dispatch. We contacted Dispatch and relayed all our indications to them and they communicated with Maintenance. Maintenance's response was they felt the L ADC was bad and to use the R ADC information, just as the checklist guidance provided. After finishing communication with Dispatch the PM summarized our situation and asked if the PF had any input or questions prior to continuing. We both agreed we were on the 'same page' and setup and briefed the approach. We advised ATC we were ready for the approach and told them we would like to join the ILS 36L outside of ZZZZZ1 at 4,000 ft. ATC provided vectors and then switched us to final Approach Controller. On the approach frequency the controller changed our landing runway to 36C. The PM setup the XXC ILS and briefed the PF on the changes. We joined the LOC XXC approximately 10-15 miles outside of ZZZZZ at 4,000 ft. I told the Approach Controller we would be in a non-normal approach configuration and our airspeed would be higher than normal. I also told the controller not to put anyone in front of us to reduce the likeliness of a go-around. On the final approach course the Approach Controller asked us to slow twice and to descend. The first airspeed reduction was not an issue and we slowed. He asked us to descend to 3,000 ft and I told him we would like to stay at 4,000 ft and follow the GS guidance down on the approach. He approved this and then asked us to slow again. I told him 'you are not making this easy, we are [a priority] aircraft'. I told him this because we were [a priority] aircraft and our plans were to be stable and configured on the ILS no later than 10 miles out to reduce our possibilities of becoming unstable on the approach. We continued the ILS XXC Approach with the FO as PF and the Captain as PM. The approach and landing were normal. Per our plan and brief, the PF (FO) brought the airplane to a stop on the runway and then transferred the controls to the Captain to taxi. Once clear of Runway XXC we cancelled the emergency and taxied to the gate. Unreliable Airspeed due to ADC failure		[Report narrative contained no additional information.]		An air carrier flight crew reported experiencing an ADC #1 failure, failure of the Captain's Airspeed and altitude. The crew performed the QRH checklist and landed without incident.

I slept for a couple of hours, but could not sleep more than that. I felt fine when arriving for duty. I was coming off of [several] days off. I was the pilot monitoring and the First Officer was the pilot flying. Weather was extremely clear and daylight. Light tailwind at altitude. Very light airplane with 10K fuel and empty cans. We were both extremely tired, and communication was degraded between us due to a loud cockpit and mixed headset use (I was using an ANR headset and the FO (First Officer) was using [an ear plug style headset] with the left plug out of his ear so he could hear me). As it turns out, this is not a good CRM setup and communication was compromised between us. I didn't realized the FO was struggling to hear me throughout the flight until we discussed it on the ground.ATC kept us very high before clearing a descent to intercept the ILS XXL about 5 miles from ZZZ. I mentioned to the First Officer that it was going to be difficult to shoot the approach due to this. We were slightly high and fast just outside ZZZ and I suggested we needed to drop the gear and slow down to get stabilized. We were still 10 to 15 knots fast as we approached ZZZZZ, but on glideslope and it looked like we would be on speed at 500 AGL. I suggested we may need to do a go-around. I thought the FO acknowledged, but after the fact he told me he wasn't sure if I was commanding a go-around and was thinking I was waiting to see the results of a continued approach. On our previous leg we discussed going around and the shared belief that a go-around at altitude should be a slow paced methodical event. The autopilot should be engaged and both crewmembers on the same page. I honestly thought that's where we were headed. I made a mistake at that time by not being very specific and commanding a go around. We were on speed and stable at 500 AGL and it was a normal landing. However, I felt we were at the limits of FOM compliance and I don't like to be in that situation.We talked about it in the parking lot and we both realized we were very tired and the FO felt he was behind. We both decided if we could do it again we should have executed a go-around to eliminate any potential for problems. Being kept high in a light airplane is always a challenge, but add fatigue and degraded CRM due to communication difficulties to the mix and the task saturation is very high. As a suggestion, it would be extremely helpful if [we] had hot mics. The enhancement to communication would be a dramatic improvement and a real safety addition.		The flight in question was the return leg to ZZZ that departed [early morning.] I was off for several days prior to this flight and got a 2 hour nap before going to work for the first leg. Initially, I felt well rested and ready to fly. That changed significantly on the second leg. By the top of descent, I was feeling very tired. On this leg I was the pilot flying and the Captain was pilot monitoring. We have flown together before and work well together from my perspective. We were arriving on the Arrival and approaching ZZZZZ we were still being held at 8000 feet. The CA (Captain) requested lower and we were finally cleared to descend to 4000 feet and cleared for the approach. Immediately the CA commented that it would be a challenge to get down, slowed up and configured in time. I heard the comment but did not respond to it or fully appreciate that he was really pointing out that we were already behind. I still felt fine. I recognize now that I was really tired and just not reacting as quickly as I normally would have. Once on the localizer I hit the appr button but it was a little too late and the aircraft failed to capture the glide slope. I initially hit the V/S button to regain the glideslope and then immediately realized we did not have enough time for that so I disconnected the autopilot. At that point I heard the CA say something about the gear but to be honest I was having a difficult time hearing him. He was wearing an ANR headset and talking a little soft. I struggled with it the whole flight but he did not know it because I failed to tell him. That was a CRM breakdown on my part. We got the gear down and started working the flaps and the aircraft began to slow rapidly. I heard the CA mention the approach was not looking good and I was preparing myself mentally to execute a go around. As we passed through 1000 feet I do not recall what the parameters were but we did managed to get stabilized by 500 feet and make a normal landing on speed in the touchdown zone. However, this approach never should have continued. Recognizing I was not fully stable and my situational awareness was deteriorating I should have executed the go-around procedure long before I ever got to the 1000 foot call. In the future if I find myself in a similar situation I will communicate more effectively with the CA and execute the go around early in order to slow things down and start again. Secondary causal factors in this event were my fatigue and a breakdown of communication between myself and the CA. Both of those factors could have been mitigated by better CRM on my part. I should have let the CA know how tired I was feeling and that I was having difficulty hearing him. Going forward I will take those lessons with me as well.		B757 flight crew reported communication breakdown between Captain and First Officer and degraded CRM during approach.

We had been on a right SLOP (Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure), we had started encountering wake turbulence from an aircraft 2000 ft above. I decided to return to the track to avoid the wake. I deleted the offset and used heading to return to the track and engaged LNAV again. We were on track and LNAV. I had to go to the Lav. When I returned the First Officer (FO) said we were left of track three miles. I saw we were in HDG mode. I immediately turned to the route and re-engaged LNAV. I know we had verified LNAV after deleting the SLOP I think it's possible that I hit the HDG SELECT button as I exited the seat. Should be more aware of FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator) indications when we change seats and positions.				B767-300ER Captain reported a track deviation in oceanic airspace following a wake encounter.

On taxi the ground controller reported the new ATIS was current, which we had and I reported we had ATIS. The weather this morning was poor with reported visibility of 1/4 mile and a 200 feet indefinite ceiling. This ATIS also reported that CAT II/III operations were in effect. After this radio call the controller cleared us for takeoff on Runway 7. At this point we were still roughly 2,000 feet from the end of the runway and taxing slowly due to the poor visibility. We accepted the takeoff clearance but advised we would need time in position before takeoff (The temp was below 3C we needed to do the engine run up per company procedures). The controller responded with approved and advise when rolling. We figured there must not be any other traffic around but looking back on this the controller probably could not see our location on the airport due to the low vis and thought we were closer to the runway than we were.When reaching to preset the departure frequency I realized we were still on Ground and were cleared to takeoff on the ground control frequency (The same controller was working both) so I switched to tower. After switching to tower I heard our company aircraft, Aircraft Y, checking in on the ILS. It sounded like approach might have handed them over late. After this aircraft checked on the tower asked us if we had started rolling yet and we responded that we had not yet taken the runway. At this point we were between taxiway H and runway 7 on taxiway F. The tower controller once again asked us to verify that we were clear of the runway. We replied that we were clear of the runway and we were holding short. At this point we were holding short of Runway 7 on F and we could see on TCAS the inbound traffic was at 700 feet. The captain then asked me if we had entered the ILS Critical Area and neither one of us could remember passing the sign for one but we were not necessarily sure since we had been cleared for takeoff so early. Since vis was low with CAT II/III ops in effect, traffic on short final, and we were not sure if we were inside the ILS Critical Area or not (we were holding short of the runway) we decided to lean on the side of safety and reported to tower that we were inside the ILS critical area. The controller then instructed our company aircraft to go around, which they did. After they went around we were issued a new takeoff clearance and time in position to do our run up. We departed and completed our flight without any problems.After we departed we studied the jepp charts and could not find a ILS hold line depicted at RFD. Upon arrival [at our destination] we called RFD Tower on the phone and asked to clarify. The controller working our departure had already gone off duty but the controller we spoke to told us that the ILS Critical Area for Runway 7 was co-located with the hold short line and that we had not entered into the ILS Critical Area. He thanked us for taking a proactive approach to safety and said there were no issues. Looking back it seems we caused our company aircraft to unnecessarily go-around by erroneously reporting inside the ILS Critical Area. This was not intentional but since we were in doubt we leaned on the side of safety.				B767 First Officer reported low visibility and communications breakdown between flight crew and ATC resulted in ground conflict.

Tower was concerned that we may have pushed back onto the taxiway from [gate] without clearance. We had followed procedures outlined on MIA JEP CO Airport Info. In brief, procedures indicate to call 'Miami Gates' for pushback from [parking] then contact ground for taxi. At this time, I can specifically recall what Gates said. I do know there was nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing said seemed different than expected. We pushed onto taxiway, started engines without incident. Upon requesting taxi clearance we were asked to contact Tower by phone. The conversation was informative. We were told we should have obtained clearance from Ground for push, Miami Gates was not authorized to issue push clearance. I explained that I believed we were clear to push, but that I may have been in error. Tower said that there was no issue. The identified JEP CO page is misleading. Even though [the gate] isn't specifically identified, [other spots] are. [The other spots] are located in the same general area, so I used those procedures. The procedures seem unambiguous and nowhere indicate to call Ground for pushback clearance. The note to view positive apron control and pushbacks doesn't give any further guidance for [these] spots. Update identified CO page to reflect proper procedure.				Air carrier Captain reported no published procedure for pushback from gate.

Shortly thereafter, the tower advised the Runway XY RVR had dropped to 2,100 after I had released brakes and was truing up the power settings. After the exchange with the tower what flashed through my mind was akin to 'That's rollout, not controlling, and they didn't drop the prevailing value' - and by then airspeed was alive and I put it out of my mind.It was only as I was climbing on course that I digested further - this RVR report made the ILS XY - my only viable option for returning to ZZZ - below minima. This was the first time I have departed using OpSpec C057. I had gone over the approaches & criteria about an hour before and hadn't imagined/'briefed' for this particular scenario - which I could have anticipated, as the forecast had been amended repeatedly. In retrospect, although I believe my departure was legal and this is not an 'event' - barely - I did have enough time to abort safely, just not enough time to think it through. If I had received this information while taxiing or holding short I think I would have decided against taking the runway. I was not 'gung-ho' and thinking of completing the 'mission.'Contributing factor may be [lack of staffing] in the tower at this hour - he got my release, issued takeoff clearance, and then proceeded to issue a new METAR.I reviewed the sequence of events repeatedly. Aborting the takeoff could have been an over-reaction. In future I will include this type of scenario in my departure brief/self-brief.				Beech 1900 Captain reported not recognizing during takeoff roll that the decreasing runway visibility would not permit a return to the field if necessary.

I made a turn to the left keeping my eye out and on the flocks watching all of them as they passed off the right side of the aircraft inadvertently turning 30 degrees as ATC indicated. I was contacted by ATC of the deviation and realized in my attempt to divert from the geese, I inadvertently flew off course resulting in a deviation of the flight planned clearance route. Upon notification from ATC, I resumed navigation back to V23 keeping an eye to the sky for more geese. The rest of the flight was uneventful.

It was an optical illusion with the width of pavement I confused the edge lights as taxi lights.

After selecting flaps 20 we received a master caution TE FLAP DISAGREE EICAS message and corresponding annunciator light. I asked the PM (Pilot Monitoring) to run the TE FLAP DISAGREE checklist. While retrieving the check list, we decided a GA (Go Around) was the best course of action to work the issue. Our instructions were to fly runway heading and climb to 3000 feet. When I initiated the GA I anticipated the aircraft to level off or climb very little since we were already close to 3000 feet. It became apparent that it was not going to be close. So I disconnect the auto pilot and began a controlled level off and power reduction, aware of our potential flap issue and possible flap overspeed. We climbed to approximately 3500 feet while ATC gave us clearance to 4000 feet. We remained on ATC vectors while working the checklist and communicating with Dispatch. After completing the checklist and conversing with the company we landed flaps 20 uneventfully. On our taxi to the ramp [ground personnel] thought they detected a possible hot brake, so they followed us to our parking spot. We advised ramp control to keep the ground personnel clear until [others] could better assess the situation. Once in the blocks the brake temps were determined to be ok. Looking back my altitude deviation could have been avoided by simply selecting ALT HLD immediately after GA, then selecting V/S for the smaller adjustments. The FO (First Officer) did a great job running the checklist, talking to Dispatch, as well as staying engaged with me while I was flying the aircraft and talking to ATC. I'd like to express a thank you to our great training department and the people involved. It was brought to our attention that our 757/767 fleet experiences these types of flap/slat issues 1 to 2 times a week. If this is the case it would be beneficial to notify our crews that there is an issue with the fleet.				B757 Captain reported a trailing edge flap disagree problem.

It was discovered that the aircraft departed ZZZ1 with the crew not being aware that the empty cargo containers had been removed from the aircraft by the station the previous evening. In retrospect the weight and balance information we were provided may have been inaccurate due to the cargo bins having been removed.Once at ZZZ we were advised that before continuing on to [our next planned destination] we would have to fly the aircraft back to ZZZ1, pick up the containers, and return to ZZZ to pick up the cargo and passengers, thus adding two more segments to the pairing. We flew back to ZZZ1 and I called the dispatcher and we conferenced (crew desk) and (FAR 117 desk). I asked if the pairing was being built legally and was told it was. I expressed that we would be willing to waive duty should we encounter operational delays. Considering the complexities of FAR 117, interpretations, and the mixture of operations, we relied on the expertise of the FAR 117 desk. Crew scheduler said that there were some odd codes popping up in his diagnostics but that he would consult with the manager when he arrived in a few minutes and get back to me if there were any problems. I emphasized that he should contact us ASAP if there were. We flew back to ZZZ and never heard anything from [the crew scheduler].Upon review of the situation I am concerned that the way that the pairing was rebuilt may have violated two FARs. It appears that the crew scheduler built the new pairing projected [to exceed the duty limit by eleven minutes].Further I believe that the crew may have violated subpart (d) of FAR 117.17 Flight duty period: Augmented flight crew.(a) For flight operations conducted with an acclimated augmented flight crew, no certificate holder may assign and no flight crew member may accept an assignment if the scheduled flight duty period will exceed the limits specified in Table C of this part.(b) If the flight crew member is not acclimated:(1) The maximum flight duty period in Table C of this part is reduced by 30 minutes. (2) The applicable flight duty period is based on the local time at the theater in which the flight crew member was last acclimated.(c) No certificate holder may assign and no flight crew member may accept an assignment under this section unless during the flight duty period:(1) Two consecutive hours in the second half of the flight duty period are available for in-flight rest for the pilot flying the aircraft during landing.(2) Ninety consecutive minutes are available for in-flight rest for the pilot performing monitoring duties during landing.(d) No certificate holder may assign and no flight crew member may accept an assignment involving more than three flight segments under this section.		We landed in ZZZ to find out that our cargo bins had been removed during our overnight at ZZZ1. The company directed us to return to ZZZ1 to retrieve these bins and return to ZZZ to pick up the charter to [their destination.] By doing this we added 2 unplanned legs to the day and exceeded FAR 117.17(d). As 777 pilots it is rare for us to have more than one leg a day. So we were concerned about our duty day limitations but no one considered a leg limitation. We extended our allowed 2 hours in order to complete the mission. I suspect that we also departed ZZZ1 with incorrect weights due to the fact that we assumed our cargo bins were on board.		B777 flight crew reported concerns about the legality of duty time and number of legs flown with an augmented crew.

MX had also found, sometime after our arrival, that the O2 valve was in the closed position. To the best of my knowledge, the proper O2 checks were done before we left [our departure field], including the 10 second bleed test that was done by my FO (First Officer), with no abnormalities noted. We did not note any discrepancies upon arrival, although neither the FO nor myself recall checking the O2 level after landing, as this is not included in any post flight duties. I would suggest closer attention be paid to the O2 levels in flight. This does take a conscious decision as this page is not normally displayed in flight. Do not make assumptions that proper MX procedures are followed, as the logbook was stamped that it was approved for return to service. Always back yourself up.	The reporter explained that there were no problems with the oxygen system during his flight. After the flight (about 2.5 hours after he left the airport) he was contacted by the oncoming flight crew who said the Crew O2 level was low and the O2 valve was in the closed position. He had no idea how that could have happened. The on-coming crew suggested he file a report even though he did not detect any anomalies during his flight.			B767 Captain reported that the crew O2 level was found low during pre-flight by the next crew on the aircraft.

As the lever was extended, the aircraft started an abrupt roll to the left. It was confirmed via the synoptic display that the spoilers on the left and partially on the right were not extending. The crew extended the gear to slow the aircraft to the ATC requested speeds during approach as there was no way to slow without properly functioning spoilers.  Aircraft malfunction. Heavy rain in ZZZ could have frozen the controls in cruise flight.  Examine each aircraft to make sure water intrusion doesn't happen.

Center hydraulic quantity was at 0.48 and decreasing. Contacted Flight Control and decided to divert. We decided to try to land while we still had center hydraulic pressure. We kept our speed up and received an ARTR (Amended Release to Read) for change of destination. It began to appear that we would not land prior to losing all center hydraulic fluid, so we descended about 50 NM early and extended the landing gear with 0.13 in the center reservoir. The gear extended normally, but when we selected Flaps 1 we lost all center hydraulic pressure. We followed AOM procedures for lost C HYD pressure, [advised ATC] and landed. We had a 757 Captain jump seating with us and we use him to aid the FO (First Officer) as PM (Pilot Monitoring) in executing the non-normal checklist and procedures.

While reviewing the aircraft maintenance logbooks that were contained within the metal maintenance can it was discovered that the aircraft was missing the chronological logbook that preceded the active logbook. There was a second 'blue' logbook within the can but, it was not the required preceding logbook specified within our manuals. I opened a write up on the most active page stating the discrepancy. I then called the dispatcher and briefed him of the situation and informed him I needed to speak to a Chief Pilot with regulatory relief authority. A 'Duty Pilot' was brought into the conversation along with maintenance control. After explaining to the Duty Pilot the situation and that this very thing had happened on the previous flight the night before on a different aircraft a Chief Pilot was brought into the conversation. Chief Pilot [Name] entered the conversation and after it was determined that he still had relief authority maintenance developed a plan to send copies of all the pages contained within the missing 'blue' logbook. Captain [Name] said he would apply his authority and that an ACAR's message would be sent backing up the verbal acknowledgment. With Captain [Name] authority and with the dispatchers and my concurrence we waited for maintenance to provide the documentation. The promised ACAR's message arrived and a copy was entered into the trip envelope and a copy was left with the station. The active 'blue' logbook maintenance write up was cleared with a signed off with maintenance personnel in [Station Code] and the required pages in numerical order were reviewed and placed within the metal maintenance can. This situation happening twice in consecutive days on consecutive flights in two different aircraft shows a huge maintenance procedural breakdown. The extremely high reliance on contracted maintenance with limited direct [Name] company employee supervision may appear to be a contributing factor as to how the maintenance controlled document was somehow removed and the aircraft continued to move within the system with this discrepancy undetected. Please, please, address the inconsistency's that are becoming increasingly prevalent within our operations between the maintenance group and the flight operations group. To have consecutive mirrored issues dealing with the same maintenance logbook issues on consecutive flights in two different aircraft is just plain not acceptable.				Air carrier Captain reported discovering the Aircraft Maintenance Log Book missing during pre-flight. Worked with Maintenance to get missing documentation on board the airplane as required.

Had adequate rest in ZZZ1 (6-8 hours) in the evening before commuting to ZZZ2. Leg 1: jumpseat, ZZZ2-ZZZ. I slept 2.5 hours on the way to ZZZ. Leg 2: operated, I was the pilot monitoring. During taxi to runway, received level 1 alert messages: 'Autopilot Single' and 'No Autoland.' Referenced QRH procedures. Both messages, the procedures were the same. Code = 'MAINT.' Consequences = 'NONE.' Taxi and takeoff continued. I was the pilot monitoring for the flight. During climb out phase, autopilot was off. Captain felt higher than normal elevator nose down control forces. After flap/slat retraction, the plane continued to exhibit cyclical fore/aft 'porpoise-like' movement involving nose down pushing forces, which were countered by the Captain, the pilot flying. We used the autopilot disconnect switches on the yokes to verify the autopilot was disconnected. 'AP OFF' was displayed on PFD. Captain told me to [request priority handling] and vectors for a long straight-in approach to runway 10 at ZZZ (other runway was closed) while he continued to fly the aircraft and maintain aircraft control. With Center, I [requested priority handling], stated 'mayday' and requested vectors to runway 10, and told ATC we were experiencing flight control malfunctions.We did not receive any level 3, 2, 1/0 alerts, nor did any of the 'non-alert' messages in the QRH pertain to this situation. We did not dump fuel (not needed). We used the long approach and the time over the water to configure the aircraft and determine if there were any controllability issues at the slower approach speed. Airplane was still controllable, although the constant nose-down pushing forces remained present throughout the entire flight. ACARS divert was sent, as well as the landing performance request. FMC was configured for straight in ILS approach to 10. During landing phase, I helped guard the controls due to the large nose down forces. Landed safely and taxied clear. Cancelled [priority handling], although Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting followed us to the ramp due to possible hot brakes.Additional notes and observations: First and most importantly, there needs to be a company checklist in place whenever a crew [receives priority handling] for what happens afterwards! I feel like I have been twisted and turned upside down after this event and have no idea where to go. I was rescheduled more than 5 times after this event to include line check with a check airman. The crew should be put into immediate rest, allowed to decompress and process, and then dead-headed home, without worry of a flight or a check ride.1) Trying to find anything specific in our manuals is one of the most difficult and time consuming activities I have ever done. If you do not type the phrase into the search engine perfectly, you will not find what you need. Also, bookmarks disappear as well as notes and highlights with all the incessant and non-stop changes to our manuals. For instance, it took me almost 30 minutes to find the specific phrase the captain needed for the write up. It had been moved, and moved again in the FOM.2) Indications from the CFDS (Centralized Fault Display System) show the previous crew began to have malfunctions at approximately 1,900 feet on their arrival into ZZZ. We were not aware of this. There was also a previous write-up in the logbook with similar malfunctions.3) Company training is phenomenal with regards to the simulator and learning muscle memory. However, our manuals and the constant changing of company procedures and moving of information around in the manuals contributes to the confusion.4) A suggestion is to only allow changes to the manuals 2 times per year. This would allow us to gain a familiarity with where everything is located, and hopefully, end the ever present confusion of 'where was the written again? Or where can I find that?' It is so frustrating trying to use our manuals now.5) I will have to develop my own way of searching through the manuals, to include probably printing the specific pages to have available instantaneously.		First Officer and I deadheaded ZZZ2-ZZZ. We both slept on the way there. Normal preflight. No deferrals. Loading was delayed and we pushed 29 minutes late. Cost index was 200 so not much ability to make up time. During taxi, approaching runway, First Officer noticed Level 1 alerts Autopilot Single and No Autoland. QRH was referenced. It had a 'MAINT' code with consequences 'NONE'. These are not uncommon alerts and can be spurious and come and go. Decision was made to continue. All applicable checklists run and required briefings accomplished. During takeoff, on initial rotation, I noticed a greater 'pull' than normal was required. As we climbed away, I was feeling more downward pressure on the control column than normal. I trimmed away the pressures and continued to climb. Pressures returned and seemed unpredictable. I was feeling an oscillation in the control column. It felt as though the autopilot was engaged, but it was not. There were no alerts or messages. I tried to disengage the autopilot multiple times. When I had the pressures at a minimum, I used light finger pressure and showed the First Officer and the jump seater that the control column was moving forward and aft in an unpredictable nature with no pilot inputs. The aircraft mechanic was also called up to the cockpit to see the movements and to solicit ideas. A level off was requested. Downward pressure would come and go and I needed to continually trim even though the airspeed was not changing. I asked the First Officer to [request priority handling] and vectors back to ZZZ. The jump seater First Officer became a vital part of the crew.He provided valuable inputs and helped with ACARS. We considered a controllability check, but decided against it because the unpredictable nature of the flight control forces. Additionally, I elected to not engage the autopilot as I did not know if it might make matters worse. In my opinion the safest course of action was to land as soon as possible. Landing calculations were run and we asked if the longer runway would be available to us. ATC said it would take some time for the other runway and we elected to accept Runway 10 and use auto brakes Max. Control column forces were heavy during the approach. First Officer told me he would be on the controls as we approached approximately 200 feet. I told him that it was a good idea. Landing was uneventful. We stopped on the runway and taxied clear. [Priority handling] was cancelled, but we requested the firetrucks to remain as we got towed into parking as the brakes were warm and we did not know if we would experience hot brakes. We debriefed maintenance personnel and called the company. As we were decompressing and preparing the logbook write-up, First Officer noticed a similar incident had been written up [previously]. In retrieving data maintenance personnel noticed that the aircraft was experiencing related faults from 1,900 feet on the last flight into ZZZ. First Officer was exceptional on this flight. His CRM skills were noteworthy and he allowed me to aviate while he handled the communications and backed me up. Upon reflection I am not sure what could have been done to prevent this event from recurring. It seems that this aircraft may have had a history of flight control anomalies during the approach phase. Corrective actions were taken. Problems worsened and were evident during all phases of flight. If the fleet is experiencing widespread flight control issues an in-depth inspection of associated systems may be prudent. One other unrelated aspect of the flight that I could have handled differently was to cancel our takeoff clearance and contact dispatch to see if a deferral may have been required for the Level 1 Alert. We were already 30 minutes late and one of the alerts had already extinguished. I may have been too mission oriented and in rereading the exact wording in [the manual], it warranted at least a call to dispatch.		Air carrier flight crew reported a flight control problem resulted in a return to the departure airport.

I had First Officer cycle gear with same result. We notified ATC that we needed to discontinue approach because of unsafe gear. We were given straight ahead to 3400 feet then followed by a turn to 270 and climb to 5000 feet. After cleaning up jet and after takeoff checklist complete. I told ATC to vector us for another approach while we worked checklists.  We attempted another gear extension with unsafe indication. I called for the L/G Unsafe Indication QRH checklist directed by ECAM. We followed QRH PROC. With the unsafe indication on both panels we followed the QRH PROC. L/G Gravity Extension and got three down and locked with gear doors open. We let ATC know that we had no nose wheel steering and could we roll to the end so company could tow us in. We let ATC know we were secure. Mechanic pulled up and we had him pin all landing gear. We sent ACARS to [Operations Control] to inform them of situation. I made [a maintenance log] entry and briefed the mechanic of event. Mechanical failure of gear doors or landing gear mechanism.

Takeoff was normal with no complications. Climbing out at about 10,000 feet, we started to smell something and noticed the oil pressure on the left engine was falling. Then the oil temperature started rising. Captain gave the FO (first Officer) the airplane, so he could get into the checklist. FO took the controls, Captain radioed for a level off altitude. The oil temperature turned red and the oil pressure was very low, as well, no oil pressure light. FO pulled the engine back towards idle to try to get the oil temperature to lower. Captain started in on the Oil Temperature Checklist. FO leveled off at 12,000 feet and slowed to 250 knots. Captain requested a turn back to [the departure airport] to land. ATC began giving us vectors and lower altitudes. The oil temperature began a nice decrease. With the oil temperature back in the normal range, the oil pressure began rising, as well. We returned for the ILS approach with delay vectors to complete the checklist, brief, and landing data. On the approach the oil pressure and oil temperature was parallel to the good engine. A normal approach, landing and taxi in with shut down checklist was completed. As a crew, we worked seamlessly well together! The Captain did a superb job.				B757-200 First Officer reported a drop in oil pressure and a rise in oil temperature in the left engine during climb and returning to departure field.

We had a normal takeoff and departure. We were climbing with the autopilot engaged at a derated climb thrust through 10,500 feet when I thought I smelled a hint of something. Checking the engine instruments we noticed the left engine oil pressure was just barely above the low oil pressure amber band and the left engine oil temperature was high and climbing. The First Officer suggested we request a level off from ATC as I was beginning to pull back the thrust on the left engine. At this time I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer. I requested a level off at 12,000 feet with ATC to address an engine problem. The oil temperature gauge turned red indicating an overheat and the oil pressure was still very low. I pulled out the High Oil Temperature checklist from the QRH while the First Officer continued to reduce thrust on the left engine. By following the checklist we were able to reduce the oil temperature without having to shut down the engine. The faint smell also dissipated. We advised ATC that we would like to return to ZZZ. I also asked ATC if they could advise our company of our air turn back. We then transferred control of the aircraft back. Having just shot the ILS Approach on the previous leg, setting up and briefing went quickly. We also mentioned differences if we had to go around. We extended the downwind slightly to look up landing performance in the QRH. The approach, landing, and taxi in were normal. I was very impressed and appreciative of the First Officer's great inputs, teamwork, and professionalism during the situation.				757 Captain reported low oil quantity and high oil temperature resulting in a return to the departure airport.
